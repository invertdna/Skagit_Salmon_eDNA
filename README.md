INTRODUCTION
================================================================================

The salmon of Puget Sound are a culturally important natural resource; 
we (NOAA?) are obligated by law to monitor their population

Some of the species commonly found in these surveys:
Chinook Salmon (Salmonidae: Oncorhynchus tshawytscha)
Coho Salmon (Salmonidae: Oncorhynchus kisutch)
Pink Salmon (Salmonidae: Oncorhynchus gorbuscha)
Pacific sand lance (Ammodytidae: Ammodytes hexapterus)
Pacific Herring (Clupeidae: Clupea pallasii)
Northern Anchovy (Engraulidae: Engraulis mordax)
Shiner Surfperch (Embiotocidae: Cymatogaster aggregata)
Three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteidae: Gasterosteus aculeatus)
'smelt' -- which of these?
Topsmelt (Atherinidae: Atherinops affinis)
Whitebait smelt (Osmeridae: Allosmerus elongatus)
Surf smelt (Osmeridae: Hypomesus pretiosus)
Capelin (Osmeridae: Mallotus villosus)
Night smelt (Osmeridae: Spirinchus starksi)
Longfin smelt (Osmeridae: Spirinchus thaleichthys)
Eulachon (Osmeridae: Thaleichthys pacificus)

METHODS
================================================================================

Fyke Sites:
At Fyke sites, samples were collected at high water, just after placement of the net.
Replicates were collected approximately 2 meters apart, in rapid succession.
At most sites, all replicates were collected from the same bank.
Where access was permitted, replicates were collected from both sides of the bank.
