Notes

2016-04-21 Planning meeting

- Fish (smolts) come downstream as early as February
- Rearing continues until it gets warm, usually May or June
- both sampling techniques start in February, continue through about September
- With a 100 foot seine, entire ponds/estuaries can be effectively censused
  - About 20 every two weeks
- Fyke nets sample as tide sinks (with high confidence/efficiency)
  - 6 sites consistently, 3-4 rotating, every two weeks
- Belt transects conducted using trawl to sample water column
  - 500 meters long
  - Samples fish greater than about 100 millimeters
  - 36 per month
  - starts the week of May 16
  - low confidence
- We should only sequence samples taken at sites where methods/estimate is "good"
  - enclosed lagoons, etc
