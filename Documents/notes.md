[Sampling schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rGF1CfOnSjiN8vHExiMQmoFGV8nV1kTJqkbsKRKS8jc/edit?ts=5887f21e#gid=0)

## 2017-01-23
- Skagit River Systems Coop sampling schedule:
  - Seine: 12 index sites; 2x per month on NEAP tides
  - Fykes: 7 index sites;  2x per month on SPRING tides (high in AM)

- Total samples:
  - Fyke:   7 sites * 4 samples * 4 visits (original math was 7*4*5)
  - Seine: 12 sites * 4 samples * 4 visits (original math was 7*4*5)
- Crew needed:
  - Seines: 1 boat driver, 2 sample collectors
  - Fykes:  2 sample collectors

- Number of water samples per site:
  - optimal: 5; minimum: 4


- At two of the fyke sites, there is occasionally (when?) a mark-recapture study

- Personnel: *Ole's kid arrives ~ March 22, don't rely on him Feb 22 - April 22*
  - Boat drivers:
    - Wes, Ole, Kelly, Greg
  - Sample collectors:
    - Ole, Jimmy, Correigh, Josh, Jason, ?Kinsey?, Anna, Kelly, Ramon, Jono, Correigh, Katherine, Stu, Jenny, Raphael, ?Hollings Scholars?
  - Molecular (extractions, etc):
    - Jimmy, ?Abby?, ?Ask Jameal if there is money?

- Fish abundance in time:
  - __________: begin: early-Feb; peak: mid-March; end: mid-May
  - __________: begin early Feb and quickly peak; wind down through March, second slow peak in early May.


## 2017-01-11
- Specificity of chinook qPCR assay
  - Chinook and Coho may share some variation at COX3; we should test on DNA from tissue
  - Piper has tissue from these species and populations from which the variation is known. She offered to extract DNA alongside other extractions she's planning to do anyway.
  - We'll need to run the qPCR on these extractions

## 2016-04-21 Planning meeting
- Fish (smolts) come downstream as early as February
- Rearing continues until it gets warm, usually May or June
- both sampling techniques start in February, continue through about September
- With a 100 foot seine, entire ponds/estuaries can be effectively censused
  - About 20 every two weeks
- Fyke nets sample as tide sinks (with high confidence/efficiency)
  - 6 sites consistently, 3-4 rotating, every two weeks
- Belt transects conducted using trawl to sample water column
  - 500 meters long
  - Samples fish greater than about 100 millimeters
  - 36 per month
  - starts the week of May 16
  - low confidence
- We should only sequence samples taken at sites where methods/estimate is "good"
  - enclosed lagoons, etc
