definitely include these, which have amplified highly in three separate plates:
092
093
094


'std1' concentration should be ~ 9e-1 ng/uL (i.e. chinook3 diluted 1:10) or ~1e-2
nothing below ~9e-5
7 step dilution series, by factor of 5:
ng/ul:
1e-3


- USE FULL STRENGTH EDNA TEMPLATE
- expected conc in sample 094 at full strength: ~20 pg/uL (0.02 ng/uL)
