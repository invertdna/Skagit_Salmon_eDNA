### Purification of Genomic DNA by Ethanol Precipitation
Kim Parsons Protocol modified by Jimmy O'Donnell

### Materials Needed
- 95% Ethanol 
- 70% Ethanol 
- 5M NaCl
- Sterile Water

**Precipitate the DNA**
1. Add 2.5 times your DNA sample volume of 95% cold ethanol. For example, if you started with 50 μl of DNA solution, use 125 μL of 95% ethanol. Total volume should not exceed 1.5mL.
2. Add 1/10 of the original sample volume of 5M NaCl. Again if we started with 100 μl of gDNA, we’ll add 10 μl of 5M NaCl.
3. Mix by quickly inverting several times until well combined. You may see a “cloudy” or “cotton ball-like” precipitate begin to form at this point.
4. Put the tubes at -20ºC overnight to facilitate precipitation. 
5. Spin for 20 minutes at 14000 rpm in a centrifuge. Orient tubes hinge out so the pellet forms in the same spot in each tube.
6. Remove the supernatant liquid from the tubes by pouring while making sure not to disturb the pellet, followed by carefully dabbing out any droplets with a pipette. You may see a small white or translucent pellet at this point. If not, assume it is where you expect it to be.

**Wash the Pellet**
1. Add 500 μl of 70% ethanol. You may wish to try to dislodge the pellet by aiming directly above the pellet, and expelling forcefully. Invert several times to thoroughly wash.
2. Spin for 5 minutes at 13-14k rpm. 
3. Remove the supernatant liquid from the tubes by pouring carefully while making sure not to disturb/lose the pellet. 
4. Repeat steps 1-3 if a second wash is desired.
5. Air-dry the pellets just until ethanol is no longer visible, but pellet doesn’t yet look dry or cracked, about 5-10 minutes (or up to an hour). Over-drying will lead to difficulty in resuspending the DNA.

**Resuspend the DNA**
1. Resuspend the DNA by adding 200uL of nuclease-free water or 10mM Tris pH 7.5 - 8.5 and pipetting up and down to mix. If you can dislodge the pellet while doing this, resuspension will be faster.
