#### serial dilution:
MH:6 point serial dilution from 100,000 to 10 copies/reaction

To prepare 3 sets of dilutions:
  - if V is the volume of template needed for each reaction,
  - and you will do 3 replicates per plate
  - you will need 3V per dilution series per plate, plus 10% extra for pipetting error (call this 3VE)
    - whatever, let's just say we need 2uL/rxn, and will make batches of 7uL
  - for a strip of 8 tubes:
    - add 18 uL water to tube 2:8
    - add 20 uL sample to tube 1; discard tip
    - transfer 2 uL from tube 1 to tube 2, mix, discard tip.
    - transfer 2 uL from tube 2 to tube 3, mix, discard tip.
    - ...
    - transfer 2 uL from tube 6 to tube 7, mix, discard tip.
    - transfer 2 uL from tube 7 to THE TRASH! LEAVE IT PURE WATER.
  - aliquot of full strength template added to strip
