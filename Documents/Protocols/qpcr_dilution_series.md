#### serial dilution:
MH:6 point serial dilution from 100,000 to 10 copies/reaction

To prepare 3 sets of dilutions:
  - if V is the volume of template needed for each reaction,
  - and you will do 3 replicates per plate
  - you will need 3V per dilution series per plate, plus 10% extra for pipetting error (call this 3VE)
    - whatever, let's just say we need 2uL/rxn, and will make batches of 7uL
  - for a strip of 8 tubes:
    - add 18 uL water to tube 2:8
    - add 20 uL sample to tube 1; discard tip
    - transfer 2 uL from tube 1 to tube 2, mix, discard tip.
    - transfer 2 uL from tube 2 to tube 3, mix, discard tip.
    - ...
    - transfer 2 uL from tube 6 to tube 7, mix, discard tip.
    - transfer 2 uL from tube 7 to THE TRASH! LEAVE IT PURE WATER.
  - aliquot of full strength template added to strip

2016-12-09:
1. Get out three 8-strip tubes, or use three columns of a PCR plate
2. Add 4.5 microliters of water to wells 2:8 of each column
3. Add 5.0 microliters of DNA from sample ("Chinook3") to well 1.
4. For wells 1 through 6 of each column:
  - With a fresh tip, pipette to mix.
  - Move 0.5 microliters from this well to the next
  - pipette to mix, and discard tip.
5. When you get to well 7, repeat above procedure but DO NOT add to the next well. Discard the 0.5 microliters with the tip.
