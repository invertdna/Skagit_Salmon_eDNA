### Species-specific assays

We used species-specific qPCR assays for multiple species:

1. Oncorhynchus tshawytscha (Chinook Salmon) is of primary interest to our study, and we used an assay developed by Duda, Hoy, and Ostberg (?CITATION?).

2. Cymatogaster aggregata (Shiner Surfperch) is reliably abundant and spatially variable in the habitats surveyed by both beach seine and fyke traps.
They lack any external, microscopic life history stage that could obscure the relationship between counts of macroscopic individuals and DNA concentration: Along with all confamilials, they are internally fertilized and give birth to live young.
Within the family, their entire clade is distinct from other inhabitants of Puget Sound (CITE LONGO AND BERNARDI 2015 MPE, CITE http://www.burkemuseum.org/static/FishKey/embio.html).
