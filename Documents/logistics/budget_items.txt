# TODO
# [ ] go over list with Linda, Anna
# [ ] check original list of target species
# [ ] ?"think of data"?
# [ ] qPCR protocol from USGS/Piper
# [ ] investigate sequencing primers (12 mifish)

Timeline + Goals
2016-10-31 Have some preliminary data to include in a renewal (chinook qPCR)
2016-XX-XX Design qPCR primers for ( shiner perch | coho | smelt )
2016-11-01 Field sampling begins
2017-04-01 Field sampling ends
2017-XX-XX Nature paper

To get sequence data, we need: (we are doing sequencing @NWGC)
  - Flowcell (N?)
  - reagent kit (N? length?)
  - library quantification (qPCr? TapeStation)
  - library prep kit (including indexes)
  - PCR cleanup/size selection (beads? etc?)
  - PCR reagents (taq, indexed primers)
  - clean DNA

To get qPCR data, we need:
  - qPCR plates
  - qPCR reagents (ask Anna+Piper, Marshall+Duda for protocols)
  - clean DNA

To get clean DNA, we need:
  - DNA quantitation (Qubit)
  - DNA extraction stuff (Phenol Chloroform -- concerns about consistency?)
  - filtered samples

To get filtered samples, we need:
  - filter cups
  - more forceps?
  - bags/etc (I think these are plentiful in lab)
  - plastic containers?
  - bleach
  - bottles?
